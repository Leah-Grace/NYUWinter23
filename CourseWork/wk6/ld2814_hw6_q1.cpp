/*

The	Fibonacci	numbers sequence, Fn,	is defined	as	follows:
F1 is	1,	F2 is	1,	and	Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 for	n =	3,	4,	5,	...	
In	other	words,	each	number	is	the	sum	of	the	previous	two	numbers.	The	first	10	numbers	
in	Fibonacci	sequence	are: 1,	1,	2,	3,	5,	8,	13,	21,	34,	55
Note: Background of Fibonacci sequence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number
1. Write a function int fib(int n) that returns the n-th element of the Fibonacci
sequence.
2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer num, and then
prints the numâ€™s elements in the Fibonacci sequence.
Your	program	should	interact	with	the	user	exactly as	it	shows	in	the	following	
example:
Please	enter	a	positive	integer: 7
13
