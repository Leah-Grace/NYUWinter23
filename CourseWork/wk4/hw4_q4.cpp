//this program prompts the user for a sequence of positive integers
//the program calculates and prints the geometric mean 

//first version:
//prompts the user for the length of the sequence
//prompts the user for the sequence
//calculates and prints the geometric mean

//Second version
//Prompts the user to enter positive intgers until the sequence is ended with -1
//calculates and prints the geometric mean

//CALCULATIONS
//The dataset will contain n positive integers
//each intger is multiplied together
//the nth root of the product is calculated
//the result is returned as the geometric mean
